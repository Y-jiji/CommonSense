# CommonSense: Efficient Set Intersection (SetX) Protocol Based on Compressed Sensing

## Prerequestites

We use data structures and algorithims from libONIAK. 

Therefore, you need a system-wide installation of libONIAK. 

```bash

export ONIAKLIB='/path/to/libONIAK'
```

## Build & Run

To build the artifacts for CDMA, run the following command: 
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
```

## Reproducing Experiments
